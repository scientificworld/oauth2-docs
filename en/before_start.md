# Before Start

Before you start integrating with the system, you first need to request and obtain an API Key (client\_id) and a Secret Key (client\_secret) for your application.

Currently there is no public application portal, you need to contact with me and provide the following information:

- Application name
- Application homepage
- Application description
- Callback URL
- Scope (optional, select all by default)

The following API Keys and Secret Keys can also be used for testing. Note: **these are for testing and examples only, you MUST NOT use them in any production environment!**

API Key: F8VbRHq6GgFq4Q5Ai1pd

Secret Key: GOQ5lYaeUebMAlMejVuWdaWkFYDn4IqUCRwfaJys3dVVYbMd6s

You may also need an user account, which can be obtained by emailing account-request [at] koishi514 [dot] moe.
